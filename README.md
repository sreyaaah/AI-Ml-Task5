Objective
The aim of this task is to explore, implement, and evaluate tree-based machine learning models—specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers—on the Heart Disease dataset to predict the presence of heart disease.

Tools Used
Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn, Scikit-learn , Graphviz

Outputs
decision_tree.png: Visualization of the trained Decision Tree.

Accuracy Scores: Displayed for all three models—full-depth tree, limited-depth tree, and Random Forest.

Feature Importance Plot: Visualized the influence of each feature on prediction.

Cross-Validation Results: Ensured model generalization using 5-fold CV.# AI-Ml-Task5
